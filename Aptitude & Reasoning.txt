Logical reasoning is classified into two types:

   1.Verbal Reasoning: It is the ability to logically understand the concepts and solve problems expressed in words. Verbal reasoning tests the ability of extraction of information and implications in a sentence.
	
   2.Non-verbal Reasoning: It is the ability to logically understand the concepts and solve problems expressed in numbers/letters/figures in combination with words. Non-verbal reasoning tests the ability of deduction and induction of logic of information and implications in a problem.

The topics included in the logical reasoning section comprise of the following type of questions:

   1.Verbal Questions – These type of questions can be solved verbally and no pen-paper solution is required
	
   2.Image-Based Questions – Mirror images or paper construction based images may be given in the question and candidates may be asked to find similar or dissimilar figures
	
   3.Puzzle Questions – This includes seating arrangement or arranging people/days/months/places, etc. in different formats
	
   4.Sequence Questions – In such questions a series or sequence of people/numbers/alphabets, etc. may be given and questions based on the same may be asked
